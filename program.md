### How to get started:


In order to make some music you need an instrument. For python, that instrument is Sonic Pi. This application is made to translate python code into musical notes. To download Sonic Pi, navigate to the below link and download the app or type the following into the command terminal. 


```
$ sudo add-apt-repository ppa:sonic-pi/ppa
$ sudo apt-get update
$ sudo apt-get install sonic-pi
```

Then by running the script "WebMusicApp.py," a link will appear in the terminal that will lead you to the user interface for music generation. From there, you simply pick a song from the drop down list and hit play. If you have Sonic Pi open, the song will play immediately.
