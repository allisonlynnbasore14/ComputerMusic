This is the page for ComputerMusic.

Over the past few weeks, a few software design students teamed up to create a way to generate music on the computer. The program uses Markov analysis of musical notes to suggest various new patterns of notes and therefore making new music! In addition to using Markov analysis, we also implemented a few additional pattern identifiers in order to produce smooth sounding music using techniques in music theory. The program lets a user choose from a variety of songs to base their new music creation off of.
