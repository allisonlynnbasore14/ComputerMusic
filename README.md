### Computer Generated Music


#### Description:
Over the past few weeks, a few software design students teamed up to generate music on the computer. The program uses Markov analysis of musical notes to suggest various new patterns of notes and therefore making new music! In addition to using Markov analysis, we also implemented a few additional pattern identifiers in order to produce smooth sounding music using techniques in music theory. The program lets a user choose from a variety of songs to base their new music creation off of.

Some members of our team have had extensive musical experience. The remaining members were curious about music theory. Our mixed backgrounds gave us insight to make a webapp that people without musical experience could use and understand. Our goal was to implement an algorithm that take a song, analyses it, and produces a new melody that sounds just as good. This leads to the question of, well what sounds ‘good.’ This is where music theory come into play. 
Please investigate the rest of this site to see the ins and outs of our program.


#### Getting Started:

First, to make computer generated music, you need to fork and clone the GITHUB respitory.

Next, in order to make some music you need an instrument. For python, that instrument is Sonic Pi. This application is made to translate python code into musical notes. To download Sonic Pi, navigate to the below link and download the app or type the following into the command terminal.
